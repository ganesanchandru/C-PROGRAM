Ｑｕｅｓｔｉｏｎ:

The program must accept two integers M and N as the input. The program must print the sum of the least significant bits in the binary representation of M and N as the output.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
6 5

Output:
1

Explanation:
The binary representation of 6 is 110
The binary representation of 5 is 101
Here the least significant bits of 6 and 5 are 0 and 1 respectively.
The sum of 0 and 1 is 1.
Hence the output is 1

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
4 8

Output:
0


Ａｎｓｗｅｒ:

#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

void main()
{
int M, N;
scanf("%d %d",&M,&N);
printf("%d",M%2 + N%2);
}
