The program must accept two integers S (in cm) representing the side of a regular pentagon and A (in cm) representing the apothem of the pentagon. The program must print the area of the regular pentagon (in cm2) with precision up to 2 decimal places as the output. The apothem is a line from the center of the pentagon drawn to the midpoint of a side such that it is perpendicular to the side.
Formulae:
Area of Regular Pentagon = (Perimeter of Regular Pentagon * A) / 2
Perimeter of Regular Pentagon = 5 * S

Example Input/Output:
Input:
5 3

Output:
37.50
